## 5. Features  

### 🔹 Business Problem  
Insurance companies face challenges in identifying high-risk customers, understanding claim trends, and minimizing fraud. Raw claim records often fail to reveal actionable insights.  

### 🔹 Goal of the Dashboard  
To provide a visual, data-driven tool that:  
- Tracks claim performance across severity and regions  
- Highlights risk factors by demographics (age, marital status, region)  
- Supports decision-making for pricing, risk management, and policy design  

### 🔹 Walkthrough of Key Visuals  
- **Key KPIs (Top Cards):**  
  - Total Claims: 1513  
  - Average Claims: 0.50  
  - Total Claims Adjusted: 113K  
  - Average Claim Amount: 74.59  
  - Claim Index: 3004  

- **Claims by Severity (Bar Chart):** Distribution of Low (2113), Medium (586), and High (305) severity claims.  
- **Claims by Region (Donut Chart):** Urban (1.49K), Suburban (0.92K), Rural (0.59K).  
- **Claims Frequency vs Premium Amount (Scatter Plot):** Correlation between claim frequency and premium pricing.  
- **Claims by Age & Severity (Histogram):** Age-wise claim severity to identify high-risk age groups.  
- **Claims Severity by Region (Stacked Area Chart):** Compares total severity distribution across regions.  
- **Interactive Filters:** Policy Type, Region, Source of Lead, Marital Status for customized analysis.  

### 🔹 Business Impact & Insights  
- **Risk Profiling:** Identifies high-severity claims concentrated in specific regions and age groups.  
- **Policy Optimization:** Helps insurers design region/demographic-specific policies.  
- **Fraud Detection:** Correlation of claim frequency and premium outliers supports fraud detection.  
- **Customer Segmentation:** Provides insights on how marital status and region influence claim behavior.
