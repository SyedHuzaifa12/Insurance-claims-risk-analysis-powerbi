#Insurance claims & Risk Analysis PowerBI Project
1.	Project Title:
📊 Insurance Claims & Risk Analysis Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze insurance claims and risk patterns, helping stakeholders understand claim severity, frequency, and customer segments across regions.
2.	Project Description / Purpose:
This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of insurance claim data, enabling insurers, analysts, and decision-makers to identify claim patterns, assess risk severity, and optimize policy management strategies.

3.	Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
•	📊 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
•	📂 Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation
•	🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For calculated measures and KPIs
•	📝 Data Modeling --Relationships between policy, claims, and demographic data
•	📁 File Format – .pbix for development, .pbit for template and .png for dashboard previews.

4.	Data Source
Dataset: The dataset contains insurance claims data, including policy details, demographic attributes, and claim-related metrics. (Rooman Technologies Internship Project).	

Key fields include:

•	Policy Type (Full Coverage / Liability Only)
•	Claim Severity (Low, Medium, High)
•	Claim Frequency & Premium Amount
•	Region (Urban, Suburban, Rural)
•	Demographics (Age, Marital Status)
•	Source of Lead (Agent, Online, Referral)

5.	Features:
•	Business Problem
•	Insurance companies face challenges in identifying high-risk customers, understanding claim trends, and minimizing fraud. Raw claim records often fail to reveal actionable insights.

•	Goal of the Dashboard
To provide a visual, data-driven tool that:
o	Tracks claim performance across severity and regions
o	Highlights risk factors by demographics (age, marital status, region)
o	Supports decision-making for pricing, risk management, and policy design

•	Walkthrough of Key Visuals
-	Key KPIs (Top Cards):
o	Total Claims: 1513
o	Average Claims: 0.50
o	Total Claims Adjusted: 113K
o	 Average Claim Amount: 74.59
o	 Claim Index: 3004
Claims by Severity (Bar Chart):
Shows distribution of Low (2113), Medium (586), and High (305) severity claims.
Claims by Region (Donut Chart):
Urban (1.49K), Suburban (0.92K), Rural (0.59K).
Claims Frequency vs Premium Amount (Scatter Plot): Identifies the correlation between claim frequency and premium pricing.
Claims by Age & Severity (Histogram): Tracks age-wise claim severity, helping identify high-risk age groups.
Claims Severity by Region (Stacked Area Chart): Compares total severity distribution across regions.
Interactive Filters: Users can filter by Policy Type, Region, Source of Lead, Marital Status for customized analysis.

•	Business Impact & Insights
o	Risk Profiling: Identifies high-severity claims concentrated in specific regions and age groups.
o	Policy Optimization: Helps insurers design region/demographic-specific policies.
o	Fraud Detection: Correlation of claim frequency and premium outliers supports fraud detection.
o	Customer Segmentation: Provides insights on how marital status and region influence claim behavior.
